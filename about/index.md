## About me
I graduated with a master science degree in Mechatronics Design. It wasn't exactly a rocket science... Actually it was! One of the highlights of my studies is a [sounding rocket launch campaign]({{site.url}}/Space-technology-rocket-campaign/).

Currently I'm an independent contractor in the fields of Robotics, Drones and Software Development based in Geneva, Switzerland. If you would like to know more and potentially work with me, please feel free to get in [touch](mailto:{{{site.owner.email}}).

From November 2016 until May 2018 I've worked with Terabee as an R&D Application Engineer. I mostly helped integrating ToF distance sensors on UAV platforms for performing altitude hold, obstacle and collision avoidance. I alsoe helped develop custom mobile robotics solutions using Robot Operating System (ROS).

Between 2014 and 2016 I was working at [SkyCircuits](http://www.skycircuits.com) where I was writing ground control station software for UAV autopilots and even led an autopilot integration project on 50kg+ helicopter platform (by the way, it was super cool!).

## What are you going to find on this blog
Short answer: everything.
A bit longer answer: I'm a very keen learner. I study lots of different topics at different times. When I find something interesting I'm likely to share it on this blog. Stay tuned for more information!
